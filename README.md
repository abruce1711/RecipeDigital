# RecipeDigital

Recipe Digital is recipe sharing social network I have been working on over the summer. I created this project to learn Ruby on Rails and have now got it to a workable product. I will continue to implement features and will look to get some test users populating it soon.

RecipeDigital is using a PostgreSQL database and is currently hosted in Heroku.

Ruby Version - ruby 2.4.4
